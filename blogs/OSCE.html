        <p class="">The nurses trained abroad are required to undertake this exam of ten stations; six of which are skill stations, and each last about fifteen minutes.</p>
        <p class="">Every element of the test is important as the trainee needs to perform each of them in a satisfactory manner. The test starts with the patient’s assessment (Assessment station), followed by the planning of the nursing care (Planning station); safely administration of medication (Implementation station) and the evaluation of the care planned in the hospital or the community setting (Evaluation station). The key element of this test is the risk management – candidates’ ability to ensure the safety of the patient and themselves.</p>
